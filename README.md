"Drones" are important but a distraction. They key differentiator that this is a classic-type of UAP flap are the glowing or metallic orbs, sometimes showing flocking behavior.

The key clip from Ross Coulthart:

Ross Coulthart: "orbs and spheres are frequently reported... fighter pilots, active service... telling Enigma the metallic spheres still continuing... consistent with what AARO told the Pentagon... between Dec. 2022- sept 2024, just under 2 years, 6,226 raw reports, 4,467 approved orb sightings able to confirm were genuine, after drilling down 322 metallic orb sightings accepted, they were metallic metal or silver orbs... total orb or sphere sightings that were submitted to the Enigma Skywatching network.."

Historical Context: Similar UAP incidents have been reported near nuclear
weapons sites (e.g., Malmstrom AFB) and nuclear energy plants globally.

What’s Being Seen: Luminous orbs (orange, blue), triangular shapes, and metallic spheres.
Sightings frequently occur between 15,000–28,000 ft.
Metallic spheres lack visible propulsion, heat signatures, or seams.

Handful of historical 1940's-50's orb-related reports and later events
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Mass orb sightings of the summer of 1947, during the peak of reports and the day before the Roswell announcement:  
7/6/1947, At 5:15 p.m. in Sioux Falls, South Dakota a silver orb shot toward the southwest "faster than any plane." It flew at an estimated altitude of ten thousand feet.
